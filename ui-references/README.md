# UI References

Drop screenshots, images, or notes here for Claude to reference when designing themes/UI.

## How to share with Claude

### Option 1: Drop images here
Save screenshots/images to this folder, then tell Claude:
```
Look at the images in ui-references and use them as inspiration for [theme/component]
```
Claude can read PNG, JPG, GIF, WebP files directly.

### Option 2: Paste a URL
Just paste a website URL and say something like:
```
Check out https://example.com — I like their design, use it as inspiration
```
Claude will fetch and analyze the page.

### Option 3: Drag & drop in terminal
If using a terminal that supports it, drag an image file into the chat.

### Tips
- Name files descriptively: `robinhood-portfolio-page.png`, `webull-dark-options-chain.png`
- Add notes to filenames: `love-this-card-layout.png`
- Mix and match — drop several images for a single theme
