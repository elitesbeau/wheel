## Key Design Principles from This Board

### 1. UI Density (matthewstrom.com)
- Information density as a design lever
- Dense layouts for data-heavy apps (relevant to Pro Trader theme)
- Balance between density and readability

### 2. Progressive Reduction (LayerVault)
- UI simplifies over time as user becomes expert
- Reduce visual complexity for power users
- Relevant to showing/hiding features based on usage

### 3. Psychology of Waiting (Mercury/Facebook)
- Loading animations affect perceived speed
- Skeleton screens > spinners
- Progress indicators reduce perceived wait time
- Relevant to chain picker loading states

### 4. Focus by Negation (Kevin Powell CSS)
- Dim everything except the focus target
- Use blur/opacity to direct attention
- Powerful for modal overlays, onboarding highlights

### 5. Facebook Paper App (multiple references)
- Gesture-driven navigation (swipe, pinch, tilt)
- Full-bleed content cards
- Smooth physics-based animations
- Content-first design (chrome disappears)
- Edge-to-edge imagery

### 6. iOS Navigation Patterns (Frank Rausch)
- Drill-downs, modals, pyramids, sequences
- Clear back navigation hierarchy
- Consistent depth indicators

### 7. Good Typography for Apps (UIKonf / Frank Rausch)
- Font size hierarchy matters more than font choice
- Consistent vertical rhythm
- Reading distance affects optimal font size
- System fonts perform better on mobile

### 8. Pinch-to-Expand (Twitter iPad)
- Gestural reveal of detail
- Content zooms naturally
- Physical metaphor (paper unfolding)

### 9. Collection View Animations (objc.io / WWDC)
- Item insertion/deletion animations
- Layout transitions between grid/list
- Interactive reordering

### 10. Adjacent Possible (Prabros)
- Novel interface explorations
- Experimental interaction patterns
- Push beyond standard UI kit

### 11. Little Big Details (Path app)
- Contextual time display updates while scrolling
- Micro-interactions that delight
- Subtle but meaningful UX touches

### 12. MuseScore 4 Redesign (Tantacrul)
- Rebuilding complex domain-specific software
- Balancing power user needs with approachability
- Progressive disclosure of complexity

## Design Takeaways for Market Elites

### Apply to All Themes:
- **Loading states**: Use skeleton screens instead of spinners for chain picker
- **Focus by negation**: Dim background when modals/pickers are open
- **Micro-interactions**: Small delightful touches (like Path's time scroll)
- **Progressive reduction**: Simplify UI for returning users

### Apply to Pro Trader Theme:
- UI density principles (tight data grids, minimal whitespace)
- Information hierarchy through typography weight, not just size

### Apply to Clean Minimal Theme:
- Facebook Paper: content-first, chrome-less design
- Gesture-driven navigation patterns
- Full-bleed hero sections

### Apply to Fun Theme:
- Physics-based bouncy animations (Facebook Paper style)
- Pinch/expand interactions
- Playful transitions between views

### Apply to Luxury Theme:
- Typography hierarchy (Playfair + Inter creates clear levels)
- Generous whitespace as luxury signal
- Subtle, slow transitions (300ms+)
